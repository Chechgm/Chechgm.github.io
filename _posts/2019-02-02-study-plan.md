excerpt: This is a short study plan I have created (and studied with) for some years now. Even though I am interested in other subjects, it is heavily biased to maths and machine learning courses.
---

I am a man of many interests. I try to continuously learn about a very broad range of subjects. Nowadays, with internet access, people have the resources to learn virtually anything they want from the sources they want. Because of that, I work on a study plan that I created with the help from experts in different areas. The study plan includes courses at universities, online courses and books I want to read on a particular subject. Links will be provided when available for the interested reader to follow them. Unfortunately, I am not going to include my literary list in here (otherwise the list would be too long ;) ). As a disclaimer, I want to say that many of the subsections I have in here overlap with each other, some of the math's tracks are closely related to each other and some of the books I read for Machine Learning are already useful for my research.

## Mathematics:

I have always had a passion for mathematics. I have thought that if I had not done my economics degrees I would have done them in mathematics or architecture (I know, they are extremely different). I took many courses in mathematics during my undergraduate years and I had the opportunity to be exposed to both pure and applied maths. Besides my interest in the beauty of maths, I think they are a great tool for most of the research I do. Some papers on economics and machine learning use them heavily. The following program is largely inspired on the mathematics undergraduate of the University were I did my B.Sc. and M.Sc., Universidad de los Andes in Bogota, Colombia. Of course this list is dynammic and is probably going to change with time, if you have any recommendations/change suggestions don't hesitate to contact me with them.

## Machine Learning:

Even though you can consider econometrics as a branch of Machine Learning, I officially knew about the term and the area of research when I was doing the data science specialization in coursera by John Hopkins University. Back then, I didn't pay much attention to machine learning. It was only until the first semester of 2017 when I started thinking of some application of ML to economics and started diving deep into the study of it.

## Pilars of research
On the machine learning part of the research I am doing during my PhD I am focusing on three major areas (of course this might change in the future): Deep Generative models, Probabilistic Graphical models and Causality. On these areas of studies I read mostly papers, however there are some books that I am planning to read which might be useful for a deeper understanding of these areas.

## Thanks
I want to give special thanks to Mateo Dulce and Aldo Pareja who have helped me by recommending some of the courses I have taken and answered patiently many of the questions about what I should/shouldn't do. Of course the thanks are extended to my parents and teachers/professors throughout my life who have developed in my a curiosity about the world.
